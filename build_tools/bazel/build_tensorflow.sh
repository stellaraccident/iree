# IREE_VULKAN_DISABLE: Do not run tests that require Vulkan. Default: 1

# Build and test everything in supported directories not excluded by the tag

# Note that somewhat contrary to its name `bazel test` will also build
# any non-test targets specified.
# We use `bazel query //...` piped to `bazel test` rather than the simpler
# `bazel test //...` because the latter excludes targets tagged "manual". The
# "manual" tag allows targets to be excluded from human wildcard builds, but we
# want them built by CI unless they are excluded with "nokokoro".
# Explicitly list bazelrc so that builds are reproducible and get cache hits
# when this script is invoked locally.
